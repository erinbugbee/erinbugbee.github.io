This work introduces two new song representations for structure-based retrieval methods: Surface Pattern Preservation (SuPP), a continuous song representation, and Matrix Pattern Preservation (MaPP), SuPPâ€™s discrete counterpart. These representations come equipped with several user-defined parameters so that they are adaptable for a range of MIR tasks. Experimental results show MaPP as successful in addressing the cover song task on a set of Mazurka scores, with a mean precision of 0.965 and recall of 0.776. SuPP and MaPP also show promise in other MIR applications, such as novel-segment detection and genre classification, the latter of which demonstrates their suitability as inputs for machine learning problems.","tags":["machine learning","music information retrieval","topological data analysis"],"title":"SuPP and MaPP: Adaptable Structure-Based Representations for MIR Tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591070400,"objectID":"4aa33b83992df02efba518da6e99e207","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/talk/cohort/","publishdate":"2020-06-02T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cohort/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Power of Data and Data Visualization Cohort","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541217600,"objectID":"3e8dd278d22acbc54a7a1009ec050b5f","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/talk/math-slam/","publishdate":"2018-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/math-slam/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparing Songs Without Listening","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Melissa R.

This work introduces start-end (SE) diagrams and start(normalized)-length (SNL) diagrams, two novel structure-based representations for sequential music data. Inspired by methods from topological data analysis, both SE and SNL diagrams come equipped with efficiently computable and stable metrics. Utilizing SE or SNL diagrams as input, we address the cover song task for score-based data with high accuracy. While both representations are concisely defined and flexible, SNL diagrams in particular address issues introduced by commonly used resampling methods.","tags":["machine learning","music information retrieval","topological data analysis"],"title":"SE and SnL Diagrams: Flexible Data Structures for MIR","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520226000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520226000,"objectID":"d1274ff9cdcb0074069b7a6ee5cdb01b","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/talk/wids/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wids/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Women in Data Science Poster Presentation","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520053200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520053200,"objectID":"709de4f4ec7b6dadc02584ecdf5c3de9","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/talk/datathon/","publishdate":"2018-03-03T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/datathon/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Intro to R Programming","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://erinbugbee.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
